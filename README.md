# Research_Project_Horse_Racing
This is my MS final year project, "Horse Racing Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approach"
# Configuration Manual
## Mangesh Shivaji Ipper
### 1 Introduction
The configuration manual provide the information of software, tools used to implement
this project. It consist of the software and hardware requirements information along with
libraries which need to install, step by step process to run the project on any machine
without any issue.
### 2 Hardware Details
Your computer must match the minimal requirements for this software, which include an
i5 CPU or higher, 12GB of RAM, and 250GB of free disk space. Your PC should ideally
have SSD storage.
To run the Deep learning models need strong configuration machine to get the bet-
ter performance, if we don’t have strong computational problem it will impact on the
performance of the model and results. Laptop on which this project built, it’s hardware
configurations are shown in figure 1.
